The purpose of this repository is to provide a space where I can work with my 12-year-old son. He has much free time because his online school in New Zealand only gives him some work. We plan to create a game that he can use to learn about programming languages and basic HTML. We will only use efficient JavaScript with CSS and HTML in this project. We will start by covering concepts such as HTML tags and then move on to the basics of JavaScript and default events. After that, we will cover variables, loops, decisions, and more.
