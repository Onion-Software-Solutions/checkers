Checkers game in javascript
The idea behind this repository is to find a place to hold a piece of work that I'm having with my 12 years old son, he has lots of spare time as the NZ online school is really doesn't give him much work.
The idea is to create a game where he could use to learn about programming language and basic HTML
In this project, we will be using only good and efficient JavaScript with CSS and HTML.
At first, we are going through concepts like HTML TAGS, then the basic with JavaScripts and default events
Then variables, loops, decisions and so on...
