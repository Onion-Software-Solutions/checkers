The purpose of this repository is to provide a space where I can work with my 12-year-old son. He has a lot of free time because his online school in New Zealand only gives him some assignments. We are planning to develop a game to help users learn about programming languages and basic HTML. The game will be built using efficient JavaScript, CSS, and HTML exclusively. We will begin by teaching HTML tags and then progress to the fundamentals of JavaScript and default events. Subsequently, we will delve into topics such as variables, loops, decisions, and more.
